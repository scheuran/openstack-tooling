# Create a reference file (do this without your patch applied):

generate-constraints -p /usr/bin/python2.7 -p /usr/bin/python3 \
  -b blacklist.txt -r global-requirements.txt > baseline

# Apply your patch and generate a new reference file:

generate-constraints -p /usr/bin/python2.7 -p /usr/bin/python3 \
  -b blacklist.txt -r global-requirements.txt > updated

# Diff them:

diff -p baseline updated

# Apply the patch to upper-constraints.txt. This may require some fiddling.
